Hi, I'm a software developer by trade, and interested in bridging the worlds of software architecture and the larger world
of economics, politics and society generally.

My life influences include:

- A degree in Cognitive Science, the intersection between Computing and Psychology
- 25 years of software development and architecture
- Watching my kids grow up and their personalities develop
- Time spent travelling, including living with tribal peoples for 2-3 months
- Working with various large client companys through work, and the disfunction and political intrigue
- A keen interest in various subjects including
  - Evolution
  - Machine Learning and discrete optimisation
  - Economics
  - Politcs
  - Functional Programming, Mathematics and Category Theory
  - Complexity & Network Science
  - Cheating and Deception in the animal and human worlds
- Living in the UK through the time of Brexit


Themes in work that have influenced my thinking:

- In design, the trading off of different goals or metrics
- People and behavioural psychology, incentive structures and unintended consequences
- Maintaining complex systems over long periods of time
- Limitations of the human mind when it comes to complex code bases
- Chunking and the ability to jump from detail to overall structure quickly
- The nature of information, levels of detail and granularity

Books that have strongly influenced me recently:

- [The Elephant in the brain](http://elephantinthebrain.com) by Robin Hanson and Kevin Simler
- [The Square and the Tower](http://elephantinthebrain.com) by Niall Ferguson 


Podcasts I listen to avidly:

- [The Long Now](https://blog.longnow.org) seminars
- [Making Sense by Sam Harris](https://samharris.org/podcast)
- About 30% of guests on [Joe Rogan](http://podcasts.joerogan.net)
- [Odd lots by Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/podcasts/odd_lots)
